**‚úß Thaedras Campaign Lore Recap ‚úß**  
*Version 2.0 ‚Äì The Holy Expedition*  

---

### **Core Pillars**  
1. **The Old World (Thaedras):**  
   - A shattered land of colossal ruins, petrified giant husks, and unstable **runes**.  
   - Giants once ruled here, but their hubris unleashed the **Runeplague** via the **First Rune**, an artifact imprisoning **Karys** (Entropy entity).  
   - Now a "cursed" frontier where settlers scavenge relics and evade corrupted **Ruinemarks**.  

2. **The New World (Vespera):**  
   - A unified nation ruled by the **Iron Accord**, a council of guilds.  
   - Three dominant factions vie for power:  
     - **The Crowned Chalice** (holy enforcers of Order).  
     - **The Veiled Quill** (secretive rune-scholars).  
     - **The Tideturner Collective** (resource harvesters).  
   - Technology relies on salvaged giant relics (e.g., the *Ironclad Retribution*‚Äôs rune-boiler).  

3. **Runes & Cosmic Forces:**  
   - **Harmonious Powers (7):** *Forge (Volcanic), Tides (Aquatic), Hearth (Ember), Veil (Umbral), Crown (Auric), Wilds (Verdant), Arcana (Celestial).*  
     - Fragments of the shattered First Rune.  
   - **Forbidden Powers (2):** *Entropy (decay), Hollow (void).*  
     - Artificial runes created by giants, causing their downfall.  

4. **The Holy Expedition:**  
   - A Crusade to Thaedras, orchestrated by **The Crowned Chalice** to reclaim "holy" Auric runes and legitimize their rule.  
   - Secretly, all factions seek the **First Rune** for their own ends.

### **Factions**  
#### **1. The Crowned Chalice**  
**Theme:** *Theocratic Enforcers of Order*  
**Goal:** Conquer Thaedras to impose divine law under **The Crown‚Äôs Mandate**.  
**Power:** Military might, religious control, Auric rune authority.  
**Weakness:** Dependent on Tideturners (resources) and Veiled Quill (rune translations).  
**Secrets:**  
   - Their leader, **Hierophant Voll**, is corrupted by a **Hollow rune** masquerading as divine visions. 
   - Use forbidden Umbral runes to assassinate dissenters.  

#### **2. The Veiled Quill**  
**Theme:** *Knowledge Hoarders, Rune Archivists*  
**Goal:** Reclaim the First Rune to unlock "perfect knowledge."  
**Power:** Monopoly on runic translations, blackmail leverage.  
**Weakness:** No military; leaders are mutating from runic exposure.  
**Secrets:**  
   - Their leader, **Archivist Lylah**, is turning to stone.  
   - Sabotage the Chalice by leaking their hypocrisy.  

#### **3. The Tideturner Collective**  
**Theme:** *Resource Pragmatists, Black Market Lords*  
**Goal:** Profit from Thaedras‚Äô relics and defy Chalice control.  
**Power:** Supply chains, smuggler networks, giant-derived rituals.  
**Weakness:** Ignorant of runic origins; rituals are fading.  
**Secrets:**  
   - Founder **Bracken** learned rituals from a dying giant.  
   - Hoard unstable runes to sell as "art."  

---

### **The Holy Expedition**  
**Purpose:** Publicly a "divine crusade" to purify Thaedras; secretly a race to claim the First Rune.  
**Faction Agendas:**  
- **Crowned Chalice:** Secure Auric runes to legitimize rule.  
- **Veiled Quill:** Study the First Rune to control creation.  
- **Tideturners:** Smuggle relics and destabilize the Chalice.  

**Key Locations:**  
- **Beacon‚Äôs Reach:** The expedition‚Äôs crumbling outpost.  
- **The Petrified Forest:** A graveyard of giant husks hiding a **Verdant rune**.  
- **The Shattered Forge:** A volcanic ruin with the **First Rune‚Äôs** prison.

### **Player Hooks**  
1. **The Penitent‚Äôs Secret:** A Tideturner worker reveals the *Retribution*‚Äôs boiler rituals are failing. Fixing them requires delving into a giant tomb‚Äîand learning their runic truth.  
2. **The Hollow Prophet:** A Chalice defector claims to hear The Crown‚Äôs "true voice," but it‚Äôs a **Hollow rune** erasing memories in camp.  
3. **The Scholar‚Äôs Gambit:** The Veiled Quill offers riches to steal a Celestial rune from the Chalice‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a trap to expose their corruption.  

---

### **Mechanics**  
1. **Runic Affinity:**  
   - Casters/Martials can attune to runes for power, risking **Corruption** (DC 13 save).  
   - **Aasimar/Tieflings** can elevate runes 1/day (Celestial/Infernal effects).  

2. **Faction Reputation:**  
   - Aid factions to earn boons:  
     - **Chalice:** +1d8 temp HP during prayers.  
     - **Quill:** Decipher one rune‚Äôs properties.  
     - **Tideturners:** Steal a relic unnoticed.  

3. **Corruption Track:**  
   - Accumulate Corruption (0‚Äì10) from rune use.  
   - **3+:** Nightmares, -2 Perception.  
   - **7+:** Mutations (stone skin, glowing eyes).  
   - **10:** Become a **Ruinemark** (NPC).  

---

### **Inconsistencies to Address**  
1. **Why do Tideturners resist Chalice despite dependence?**  
   - *Fix:* They rely on Chalice protection but use smuggling to fund rebellion.  

2. **How do Veiled Quill scholars stay hidden?**  
   - *Fix:* They work through proxies (players) and destroy incriminating research.  

3. **Why hasn‚Äôt the First Rune‚Äôs prison been found?**  
   - *Fix:* The prison shifts locations, revealed only when Corruption spreads.  

---

### **Remaining Questions**  
1. Should the **First Rune** be sentient? Could it communicate with Aasimar/Tieflings?  
2. How does Karys (Entropy) interact with the factions? Does it manipulate the Chalice‚Äôs Hollow rune?  
3. What happens if the expedition fails? Does Thaedras‚Äô corruption spread to Vespera?
