**✧ Thaedras Campaign Lore Recap ✧**  
*Version 3.0 – The Crusade of Purity*

---

### **Core Lore Elements:**  

1. **The Old World (Thaedras):**  
   - Once a land ruled by giants, Thaedras fell to ruin when the giants meddled with forbidden runes, unleashing a creeping corruption that consumed their civilization. The giants vanished, leaving behind only their colossal husks and crumbling ruins.  
   - The corruption, born of the **Entropy** and **Hollow** runes, now seeps into the sea, carried by relics and debris that wash ashore in the New World. These relics, though powerful, carry the taint of Thaedras’ downfall.  

2. **The New World (Vespera):**  
   - A thousand years after Thaedras’ fall, Vespera thrives as a beacon of order and faith, ruled by the Church of the Crown. The Crown, a cosmic force representing Order and Authority, is the central pillar of Vesperan society.  
   - However, the arrival of Thaedran relics has begun to spread corruption. Strange diseases plague the slums, and whispers of unrest grow louder. The Church, ever vigilant, blames these ills on heresy and demands absolute faith in the Crown’s divine mandate.  
   - To combat the growing threat, the Church launches the **Crusade of Purity**, a holy expedition to Thaedras. Officially, the Crusade seeks to cleanse the Old World of corruption and reclaim its lost relics. Unofficially, it serves as a convenient means to exile political dissidents and consolidate the Church’s power.  

3. **Runes & Cosmic Forces:**  
   - **Harmonious Powers (7):** *Forge (Volcanic), Tides (Aquatic), Hearth (Ember), Veil (Umbral), Crown (Auric), Wilds (Verdant), Arcana (Celestial).*  
     - Fragments of the shattered **First Rune**, the source of all creation.  
   - **Forbidden Powers (2):** *Entropy (decay), Hollow (void).*  
     - Artificial runes created by the giants, which led to their downfall.
