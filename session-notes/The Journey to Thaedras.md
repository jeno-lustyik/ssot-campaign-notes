### **Session Outline**  

#### **1. Opening Scene: Aboard the Ironclad Retribution**  
- The session begins with the players gathered on the deck of the *Ironclad Retribution*, a massive ship powered by a rune-boiler. The ship is part of a fleet heading to Thaedras, carrying soldiers, scholars, and political exiles.  
- The atmosphere is tense: the crew is on edge, the exiles are resentful, and the scholars are engrossed in their research.  
- **Key NPCs to Introduce:**  
  - **Captain Elias Varn:** A stern, loyal officer of the Church, tasked with overseeing the expedition.  
  - **Archivist Lylah:** A Scribe of the Veil, visibly suffering from runic corruption (her hand is turning to stone). She is studying relics recovered from Thaedras.  
  - **Mara Bracken:** A smuggler and leader of the Blackwater Syndicate, posing as a merchant. She is secretly trading relics with the crew.  

- **Player Hooks:**  
  - Each player has a reason for being on the ship, tied to their backstory and faction allegiance. For example:  
		-

#### **2. The Storm and the First Signs of Corruption**  
- As the ship nears Thaedras, a violent storm engulfs the fleet. The rune-boiler begins to malfunction, causing the ship to list dangerously.  
- **Skill Challenge:** The players must work together to stabilize the ship.  
  - **Possible Actions:**  
    - Repair the rune-boiler (Arcana or Tinkerâ€™s Tools).  
    - Navigate the storm (Survival or Perception).  
    - Calm the panicked crew (Persuasion or Intimidation).  
    - Secure loose cargo (Athletics or Acrobatics).  
  - **Consequences:**  
    - Success: The ship is stabilized, and the players earn the respect of the crew.  
    - Failure: The ship takes damage, and a crew member is lost overboard.  

- **Foreshadowing:** During the storm, the players notice strange phenomena:  
  - The rune-boiler emits a faint, sickly glow.  
  - Shadows seem to move on their own.  
  - A crew member mutters in an unknown language before collapsing.

#### **3. The First Encounter: A Taste of Corruption**  
- As the storm subsides, the ship is approached by a derelict Thaedran vessel, its hull covered in strange, pulsating growths.  
- **Exploration:** The players are sent to investigate the derelict ship.  
  - The ship is eerily silent, its crew long gone.  
  - The growths on the hull are a physical manifestation of corruption.  
  - The players find a relicâ€”a small, glowing runeâ€”that radiates unease.  

- **Combat Encounter:** The relic awakens a **Corrupted Husk**, a twisted remnant of a Thaedran sailor.  
  - **Corrupted Husk Stats:** Use a modified Zombie stat block with added abilities, such as a corruption aura that forces a DC 13 Constitution save or gain 1 point of Corruption.  

- **Aftermath:**  
  - The players recover the relic, but it begins to affect those who carry it (e.g., nightmares, whispers).  
  - Archivist Lylah warns them to handle it carefully, while Mara Bracken offers to buy it off them.

#### **4. Arrival at Thaedras: Beaconâ€™s Reach**  
- The session ends with the fleet arriving at **Beaconâ€™s Reach**, the Crusadeâ€™s crumbling outpost in Thaedras.  
- **Beaconâ€™s Reach:**  
  - Once a colossal lighthouse built by the giants, Beaconâ€™s Reach now stands as a ruined monolith, its towering structure partially collapsed and overgrown with strange, pulsating vines.  
  - The lighthouse is so massive that the players feel like ants standing at its base. The stairs and corridors inside are wide enough to accommodate giants, making the players feel even smaller.  
  - The outpost is a makeshift camp set up in the shadow of the lighthouse, with tents and barricades dwarfed by the surrounding ruins.  

- **Atmosphere:**  
  - The air is thick with the scent of decay, and the sky is perpetually overcast.  
  - The ground trembles occasionally, as if the island itself is alive.  
  - The players hear distant, echoing soundsâ€”footsteps, whispers, or the creaking of ancient machinery.  

- **Closing Scene:**  
  - Captain Varn addresses the expedition, declaring that they have arrived to "purify this land in the name of the Crown."  
  - The players are tasked with their first mission: explore the nearby **Petrified Forest** to locate a missing patrol and investigate rumors of a powerful relic.

### **Key Notes for the DM**  
1. **Tone:** Emphasize the oppressive atmosphere of the Crusade and the growing sense of dread as the expedition approaches Thaedras.  
2. **Scale:** Make the players feel small and insignificant compared to the colossal ruins of Thaedras. Describe the massive structures, the towering lighthouse, and the overwhelming presence of the giantsâ€™ remains.  
3. **Faction Dynamics:** Highlight the tension between the Church, the Scribes, and the Syndicate through NPC interactions.  
4. **Corruption:** Introduce the concept of Corruption early, using the relic and the Corrupted Husk to foreshadow its dangers.  
5. **Player Agency:** Allow the players to make meaningful choices, such as whether to keep the relic or hand it over to a faction.  

---

### **Potential Follow-Up Hooks**  
6. **The Missing Patrol:** The players are sent to find a missing patrol in the Petrified Forest, where they encounter more signs of corruption and a powerful Verdant rune.  
7. **The Relicâ€™s Whispers:** The relic recovered from the derelict ship begins to influence its bearer, leading to visions of Thaedrasâ€™ past.  
8. **Faction Conflict:** The Scribes and the Syndicate both approach the players, offering rewards for their loyalty.
