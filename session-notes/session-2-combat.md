## **Combat Setup (For a Level 3 Party of 5)**

The **Yuan-ti cultists are performing a ritual in a ruined temple**, and the **party interrupts them**. The battlefield has **pillars, elevated platforms, and a glowing serpent altar**, which the cult priest uses as his **focus for casting**.

### **Enemy Composition:**

- **2 Yuan-ti Cultists (Melee)** ‚Äì Frontline attackers, defending the priest.
- **2 Yuan-ti Cultists (Ranged)** ‚Äì Skirmishers attacking from the edges.
- **1 Yuan-ti Cult Priest** ‚Äì Focusing on **control spells and buffs**.

### **Tactics & Strategy:**

- **Round 1:**
    
    - The **Cult Priest** casts **Shield of Faith** on himself and **Spiritual Weapon** near the party‚Äôs squishiest target.
    - **Melee Cultists** rush forward, **blocking access** to the priest.
    - **Ranged Cultists** use **Fog Cloud** (if needed) to **control sightlines** and then attack from cover.
- **Round 2:**
    
    - The **Cult Priest** uses **Hold Person** to disable a frontline fighter.
    - **Melee Cultists** continue attacking aggressively.
    - **Ranged Cultists** reposition and use **Poison Dipped Arrows** for extra damage.
- **Round 3+**
    
    - If the **Cult Priest** is threatened, he casts **Fear** and **runs toward the altar**, where the **ritual intensifies** (perhaps summoning something worse if the fight drags on).

### **Environmental Hazards & Narrative Hooks**

- **The Ritual**: If the priest isn't stopped in **4 rounds**, the temple itself starts **awakening**, summoning a **serpentine horror** (maybe a **Yuan-ti Abomination** in later sessions?).
- **Traps**: The room has **hidden pressure plates** that **release venomous gas or collapsing stone**.
- **Serpent Statue Buffs**: If a **Yuan-ti touches the altar**, they **gain temporary HP or a damage bonus**.

---

### **Conclusion & Scaling Adjustments**

- If the fight is **too hard**, remove **one melee or ranged Yuan-ti**.
- If the **party is winning easily**, give the **Cult Priest another spell slot** or **add a phase where the altar releases spectral snakes**.

Would you like me to add **loot rewards or magic items** for this encounter? üî•üêç
