_Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter in Vespera have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.
You aren't one of those folk.
You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to Vespera for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.
Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go._

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Perception  
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland  
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice  
- **Equipment:** One set of traveler's clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5gp  

**All Eyes on You:** Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parlay this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

**Purpose:** You set out into the world to experience its wonders, to embark on great journeys or face unknown dangers. Interacting with foreign cultures, engaging in diplomacy far from home, or exploring the savage wildlands are what you can consider to be your purpose.

- **Eternal Wayfarer (50 points):** You’ve seen the world through and through, and you know the people of the land. Your Wisdom or Charisma score is increased by 2, and the maximum of the chosen score is also increased by 2.
