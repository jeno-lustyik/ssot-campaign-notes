_You are a seeker of forbidden knowledge, a collector of secrets, and a master of uncovering truths that others would rather keep hidden. Whether you are a spy, a thief of ancient relics, or a rogue scholar who operates outside the law, your life revolves around the pursuit of dangerous and obscure wisdom. You spend your days deciphering coded messages, infiltrating restricted archives, and trading secrets with those who dwell in the shadows. Knowledge is power, and you wield it like a blade._

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Investigation, Stealth  
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Forgery kit and thieves' tools.
- **Languages:** Two of your choice (often ancient or obscure languages, or Thieves’ Cant)  
- **Equipment:** A set of dark, nondescript clothes, a set of thieves’ tools and a forgery kit, a satchel of stolen scrolls and coded notes, a magnifying glass, a small dagger hidden in your boot, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.  

**Keeper of Secrets:** When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, especially if it is obscure, illegal, or forbidden, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. This might be a black-market dealer, a secretive guild, or a rogue scholar who trades in dangerous knowledge. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is hidden in a heavily guarded vault, or that it requires a dangerous heist to uncover. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse often requires cunning and risk.

**Purpose:** Uncovering hidden truths, hoarding dangerous knowledge, and using your intellect to outwit your enemies. Your life is a quest for power through information, and you will stop at nothing to acquire the secrets that others fear to possess.

- **Cunning Researcher (3 purpose points):** Your ability to uncover hidden details is unmatched. You gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to decipher coded messages, detect forgeries, or uncover hidden compartments.  
- **Whisper of Shadows (10 purpose points):** Your network of contacts in the underworld grants you access to secret information. Once per short rest, you can reroll a failed Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check when dealing with criminals, spies, or black-market dealers.  
- **Master of Forbidden Lore (25 purpose points):** You have learned to uncover the most dangerous secrets. You can cast *Detect Thoughts* once per long rest without expending a spell slot. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you do not already have it.  
- **Archivist of the Veil (50 purpose points):** Your mind is a repository of the multiverse’s darkest secrets. Your Intelligence or Dexterity score increases by 2, and the maximum of the chosen score is also increased by 2. You also learn the *Modify Memory* spell, which you can cast once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
