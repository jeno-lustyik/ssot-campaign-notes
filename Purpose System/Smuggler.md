_You’ve mastered the art of moving goods unseen—whether contraband, stolen relics, or refugees fleeing tyranny. Your life is a web of aliases, hidden compartments, and contacts who ask no questions. Trust is rare, but gold and silence are your currency._  

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water or land), Forgery Kit  
**Languages:** Thieves’ Cant or one of your choice  
**Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a disguise kit, forged shipping manifests, a small blade hidden in your boot, a belt pouch with 20 gp, and a token from a grateful client (roll a d4: 1 = a silver locket, 2 = a coded map fragment, 3 = a smuggler’s brand tattoo, 4 = a lockpick set).  

**Shadow Network:** You know how to move goods without attracting attention. You can secure discreet transport for yourself and your party through illicit channels, avoiding tolls or checkpoints. Local smugglers or black-market dealers recognize your methods and may offer aid for a price (or a favor owed).  

**Purpose:** Evading authority, profiting from the unseen, and protecting those who rely on your discretion. A smuggler thrives in the margins, balancing risk and reward.  

- **Ghost Runner (3 purpose points):** You leave no trace. Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to avoid detection while transporting goods.  
- **Master Forger (10 purpose points):** Your forged documents pass all but magical scrutiny. You gain advantage on checks to create or detect forgeries.  
- **Underground Baron (25 purpose points):** Your network spans cities. Once per week, you can call in a favor to secure safe passage, temporary shelter, or information from the criminal underworld.  
- **Kingpin of Shadows (50 purpose points):** Your reputation precedes you. Your Charisma or Dexterity score increases by 2, and the maximum of the chosen score is also increased by 2.
