_You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a clericâ€”performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power._

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion  
- **Tool Proficiencies:** None  
- **Languages:** Two of your choice  
- **Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gold.

**Shelter of the Faithful:** As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

**Purpose:** Serving and spreading the word of the higher power you chose to follow, or perhaps working on uncovering lost secrets or forgotten relics of your god. The devout acolytes always work to further their faith, often by whatever means are available.
