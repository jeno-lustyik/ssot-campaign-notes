### Background: Smuggler  
_You’ve mastered the art of moving goods unseen—whether contraband, stolen relics, or refugees fleeing tyranny. Your life is a web of aliases, hidden compartments, and contacts who ask no questions. Trust is rare, but gold and silence are your currency._  

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Stealth  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water or land), Forgery Kit  
**Languages:** Thieves’ Cant or one of your choice  
**Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a disguise kit, forged shipping manifests, a small blade hidden in your boot, a belt pouch with 20 gp, and a token from a grateful client (roll a d4: 1 = a silver locket, 2 = a coded map fragment, 3 = a smuggler’s brand tattoo, 4 = a lockpick set).  

**Shadow Network:** You know how to move goods without attracting attention. You can secure discreet transport for yourself and your party through illicit channels, avoiding tolls or checkpoints. Local smugglers or black-market dealers recognize your methods and may offer aid for a price (or a favor owed).  

**Purpose:** Evading authority, profiting from the unseen, and protecting those who rely on your discretion. A smuggler thrives in the margins, balancing risk and reward.  

- **Ghost Runner (3 purpose points):** You leave no trace. Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to avoid detection while transporting goods.  
- **Master Forger (10 purpose points):** Your forged documents pass all but magical scrutiny. You gain advantage on checks to create or detect forgeries.  
- **Underground Baron (25 purpose points):** Your network spans cities. Once per week, you can call in a favor to secure safe passage, temporary shelter, or information from the criminal underworld.  
- **Kingpin of Shadows (50 purpose points):** Your reputation precedes you. Your Charisma or Dexterity score increases by 2, and the maximum of the chosen score is also increased by 2.

### Background: Gate Warden  
_You are a guardian of thresholds—city gates, mountain passes, or even mystical portals. Your duty is to monitor comings and goings, discern threats, and enforce order. Whether you served a noble lord, a mercenary company, or a secretive order, vigilance is your creed._  

**Skill Proficiencies:** Perception, Investigation  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Mason’s Tools, Navigator’s Tools

**Eyes on the Horizon:** You can spot irregularities in crowds or landscapes. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect hidden creatures, concealed traps, or disguised individuals near thresholds you guard. Additionally, you know local rumors about nearby threats and can secure modest lodging at guard posts or watchtowers.  

**Purpose:** Upholding security, neutralizing dangers before they cross into protected lands, and maintaining the integrity of borders—physical or arcane.  

- **Watchful Sentinel (3 purpose points):** You can remain alert during long watches without penalty. Your passive Perception increases by 3 while on guard duty.  
- **Chainbreaker (10 purpose points):** You excel at breaching barred doors or dismantling traps. Gain proficiency with thieves’ tools and advantage on Strength checks to force open objects.
