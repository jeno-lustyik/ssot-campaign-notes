**Background: Ghostlance**  
_You are bound to a spectral force—a restless spirit, a vengeful phantom, or a pact with the afterlife itself. Whether through a cursed weapon, a fatal oath, or a brush with death, your existence intertwines with the ethereal. You wield ghostly powers channeled through a weapon (often a lance or polearm), striking with uncanny precision and phasing through defenses. Your presence unsettles allies and foes alike, as whispers of the dead cling to your every move._

**Skill Proficiencies:** Stealth, Persuasion  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Carpenter's tools, thieves' tools  
**Languages:** One of your choice (often Celestial, Abyssal, or Primordial to commune with otherworldly forces) 
**Equipment:** A weapon with faint spectral shimmer (e.g., lance, glaive), a set of weathered but functional armor, a small urn containing ashes of a fallen comrade, a silvered chain used to commune with spirits, and a pouch with 15 gp.

**Unsettling Bond:** Once per long rest, you can phase through an attack as a reaction, granting yourself resistance to the triggering damage. Additionally, restless spirits occasionally offer cryptic warnings, granting you advantage on Perception checks to detect ambushes or hidden enemies.

**Purpose:** To fulfill an unresolved oath, purge corrupt spirits from the material plane, or sever your own ties to the afterlife. Your strikes blur the line between life and death, and your journey seeks balance—or dominance—over the unseen.

- **Eerie Fortitude (3 points):** You gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Once per long rest, when reduced to 0 HP, you can drop to 1 HP instead.  
- **Spectral Ally (10 points):** Your haunting grants fleeting aid. As a reaction, you can impose disadvantage on one attack roll against you. Recharges after a short or long rest.  
- **Warden of Shadows (25 points):** You resist necrotic damage and gain proficiency in Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect hidden creatures or magical disturbances. If already proficient, double your bonus.  
- **Harbinger of the Veil (50 points):** Your torment has forged an unbreakable will. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 2, and its maximum increases by 2. You also learn the *Hex* or *Bane* spell (cast once per long rest without a spell slot).
