### **Racial Adjustments**  
**1. Aasimar:**  
- **Celestial Elevation:** Once per week, when you use *Radiant Soul* or *Necrotic Shroud*, you may empower a rune in your party instead of the racial trait.

**2. Tiefling:**  
- **Infernal Elevation:** Once per week, when you use *Hellish Rebuke*, you may empower your Class Rune instead of dealing fire damage.  

**3. Triton:**  
- **Tide Cleanser:** Once per long rest, cleanse a corrupted rune by submerging it in water for 1 minute.  

**4. Other Races:**  
- **Goliath:** *Stonewalker* grants advantage on saves vs. runic corruption while in rocky terrain.  
- **Yuan-Ti:** *Serpent‚Äôs Gaze* allows you to stabilize a corrupted rune (1/day), delaying its effects for 1 hour.  

---

### **Corruption & Cleansing**  
- **Corruption Risk:** Only Aasimar/Tieflings trigger corruption when elevating runes (1 on a d20 roll).  
- **Effects of Corruption:**  
  - The rune becomes inert and cannot be used.  
  - The user gains a **Corruption Token** (disadvantage on saves vs. Entropy/Hollow effects until cleansed).  
- **Cleansing:**  
  - Requires a Triton‚Äôs *Tide Cleanser* or submerging the rune in a sacred spring for 24 hours.  

---

### **Example Play**  
**Barbarian (Goliath):**  
- *Rune-Carved Belt (Volcanic):* While raging, your greataxe sears foes (+1d4 fire).  
- *Empowered by Tiefling:* You deal +2d4 fire, but risk corrupting the rune.  

**Cleric (Aasimar):**  
- *Sanctified Chain (Hearth):* Allies near your *Cure Wounds* regain 1d4 HP.  
- *Empowered by Aasimar:* Heal 1d8 and cure blindness, but the rune flickers ominously.  

**Rogue (Triton):**  
- *Shadow Cloak Pin (Veil):* Your dagger whispers secrets, dealing +1d4 psychic on Sneak Attack.  
- *Corruption Cleanse:* You purify a corrupted rune for the party‚Äôs Wizard.  

---

### **Design Notes**  
- **Balance:** Features add ~+2‚Äì3 power spikes per rest, aligning with tier 1 gameplay.  
- **Thematic Tie-Ins:** Runes reflect class identity (e.g., Barbarians = primal fury, Wizards = arcane mastery).  
- **Player Choice:** Elevation is optional but tempting, creating a risk/reward loop.
